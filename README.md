# powerball-predictor
A glorified random number generator, but a fantastic way to learn ML Engineering! ðŸš€ðŸŽ°

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
Letâ€™s be honestâ€”Powerball is purely random. No ML model, no matter how fancy, can truly predict the winning numbers. So why are we doing this?

ðŸ‘‰ Because this project is all about hands-on experience in ML Engineering! We use this dataset as a sandbox to practice real-world ML skills, infrastructure automation, deployment, and scaling.

What Youâ€™ll Learn
âœ… ML Model Training â€“ Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold validation
âœ… AWS Cloud Engineering â€“ ECS (Fargate), S3, Route 53, and ALB deployment
âœ… MLOps & CI/CD â€“ Automating model deployment, containerization, and API hosting
âœ… Infrastructure as Code (IaC) â€“ Terraform for AWS infra setup
âœ… Frontend Deployment â€“ Hosting an S3-powered web app with Route 53

ðŸ’¡ The real prize here isnâ€™t the Powerball jackpot. However itâ€™s mastering these industry-grade ML & DevOps skills!
