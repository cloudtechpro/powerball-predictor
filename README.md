# powerball-predictor
A glorified random number generator, but a fantastic way to learn ML Engineering! ðŸŽ°

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
Letâ€™s be honest, Powerball is purely random. No ML model, no matter how fancy, can truly predict the winning numbers. So why are we doing this?

ðŸ‘‰ Because this project is all about hands-on experience in ML Engineering! We use this dataset as a sandbox to practice real-world ML skills, infrastructure automation, deployment, and scaling.

### What Youâ€™ll Learn

- ML Model Training â€“ Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold validation
- AWS Cloud Engineering â€“ ECS (Fargate), S3, and ALB deployment
- MLOps & CI/CD â€“ Automating model deployment, containerization, and API hosting
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) â€“ Terraform for AWS infra setup
- Frontend Deployment â€“ Hosting an S3-powered web app

ðŸ’¡ The real prize here isnâ€™t the Powerball jackpot. Although that would be nice. However itâ€™s mastering these industry-grade ML & DevOps skills!

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works
### ðŸ”¹ ML Model
- Feature Engineering â€“ Looks at historical Powerball draws for number frequency, hot/cold numbers, and trends.
- Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Uses GridSearchCV and k-fold validation to optimize XGBoost models.
- Prediction â€“ Generates a set of numbers based on learned patterns (but again, this is just a fancy randomizer).
### ðŸ”¹ Backend (Flask API)
- Hosts a /predict endpoint that serves Powerball number predictions using the trained model.
- Packaged into a Docker container and deployed on AWS ECS Fargate.
### ðŸ”¹ Frontend (S3 Website)
- Simple UI with a button to fetch predictions from the backend.
- Hosted on AWS S3 (ToDo: Route 53 for a clean domain name).

## Deployment Guide
### Deploy the Infrastructure (Terraform)
```
cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

#### This sets up:
- VPC (networking)
- ECS Cluster (backend hosting)
- ALB (load balancer for API)
- S3 Buckets (for models & frontend)

### Train the ML Model (Jupyter Notebook)
```
cd notebooks/
jupyter notebook  # Run model training inside 04-model-training.ipynb
```
Saves the trained model as models/powerball_model.pkl

### Deploy the Backend API (Docker + ECR + ECS)
```
bash scripts/build_and_push_ecr.sh
```

- Builds Docker Image
- Pushes to AWS ECR
- Updates ECS Task with New Image

### Upload ML Models to S3
```
bash scripts/upload_models_s3.sh
```
This moves the trained model pkl files to S3 for API use.

### Deploy Frontend to S3
```
bash scripts/deploy_frontend_s3.sh
```
This syncs the HTML, CSS, and JS files to the S3 frontend bucket.

### Find Your Hosted API & Website
```
terraform output alb_dns
terraform output frontend_website_url
```
- Powerball Prediction API â†’ http://your-alb-url.amazonaws.com/predict
- Frontend UI â†’ http://your-frontend-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

## Features & Best Practices
- Fully Automated AWS Deployment (ECS, S3)
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)
- Dockerized Flask API
- Machine Learning with XGBoost
- K-Fold Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Scalable Frontend Hosted on AWS S3

## Future Improvements
-  Add Route 53 hosted zone and records for clean domain name
-  Auto-scaling for ECS (Handle high traffic)
-  CloudFront CDN for Faster Frontend Load Times
-  CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) for auto-deploys
-  Dynamic Localstack/AWS deployment configuration

## Final Thoughts
At the end of the day, this is just a fun experiment to get hands-on with ML Engineering, DevOps, and AWS deployment.
